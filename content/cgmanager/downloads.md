# Distribution packages
At this time, both Ubuntu and Debian provide cgmanager packages.
On those, CGManager will typically come as a dependency of LXC or even be installed by default.
If not, just install it using your package manager.

For Ubuntu users, we have an official PPA for CGManager:

 * [cgmanager-stable](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-lxc/+archive/cgmanager-stable): Latest stable release

And for those who want development snapshots:

 * [cgmanager-git-master](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-lxc/+archive/cgmanager-git-master): "master" branch

# Current development version

You can clone cgmanager directly with:

    git clone git://github.com/lxc/cgmanager

# Release tarballs

Stable release tarballs are available for download below.
