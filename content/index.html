      <h1>Infrastructure for Linux systems</h1>
      <p>linuxcontainers.org is the umbrella project behind LXD,
        LXC, LXCFS and distrobuilder.</p>

      <p>The goal is to offer a distro and vendor neutral environment
        for the development of Linux container technologies.</p>

      <p>Our focus is providing containers and virtual machines that run
        full Linux systems. While VMs supply a complete environment,
        system containers offer an environment as close as possible to
        the one you'd get from a VM, but without the overhead that comes
        with running a separate kernel and simulating all the hardware.</p>

      <h3>LXD</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-8">
          <p>LXD is a next generation system container and virtual machine
            manager. It offers a unified user experience around full Linux
            systems running inside containers or virtual machines.</p>
          
          <p>LXD is image based and provides images for a wide number of
            Linux distributions. It provides flexibility and scalability
            for various use cases, with support for different storage
            backends and network types and the option to install on
            hardware ranging from an individual laptop or cloud instance
            to a full server rack.</p>
          
          <p>When using LXD, you can manage your instances (containers and VMs)
            with a single command line tool, or over the network in a transparent way
            through a REST API.</p>

      <h3>LXC</h3>
      <p>LXC is a well-known Linux container runtime that consists of
        tools, templates, and library and language bindings. It's pretty
        low level, very flexible and covers just about every containment
        feature supported by the upstream kernel.</p>
      <p>LXC is production ready with LTS releases coming with 5 years
        of security and bugfix updates.</p>
      <p>LXC should not be confused with the <code>lxc</code>
        CLI client tool provided by LXD.</p>

      <h3>LXCFS</h3>
      <p>LXCFS is a userspace (FUSE) filesystem which offers:
        <ul>
          <li>Overlay files for cpuinfo, meminfo, stat and uptime.</li>
          <li>A cgroupfs compatible tree allowing unprivileged writes.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>It's designed to work around the shortcomings of procfs, sysfs
        and cgroupfs by exporting files that match what a system
        container user would expect.</p>

      <h3>distrobuilder</h3>
      <p>distrobuilder is an image building tool for LXC/LXD which offers:
        <ul>
          <li>Complex image definition as a simple YAML document.</li>
          <li>Multiple output formats (chroot, LXD, LXC).</li>
          <li>Support for a lot of distributions and architectures.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>distrobuilder was created as a replacement for the old shell scripts
        that were shipped as part of LXC to generate images.
        Its modern design utilises pre-built official images whenever available,
        uses a declarative image definition (YAML) and supports a variety of
        modifications on the base image.</p>

      <h3>CGManager</h3>
      <p>CGManager is our cgroup manager daemon. It's
        designed to allow nested unprivileged containers
        to still be able to create and manage their
        cgroups through a DBus API.</p>

      <p>CGManager was used by default with LXC in
        Ubuntu since April 2014 and then by other
        distributions as they started needing working
        unprivileged containers.</p>

      <p>It has now been deprecated in favor of the CGroup namespace
        in recent Linux kernels. On older kernels, LXCFS still offers
        a cgroupfs emulation that can be used instead of CGManager
        and is more widely compatible with existing userspace.</p>
