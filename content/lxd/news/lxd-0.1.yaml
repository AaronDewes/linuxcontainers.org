  This is the initial LXD release.

  With this first release of LXD, it is possible to:

   * List containers
   * create, destroy, start, stop and execute commands into an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS amd64 container
   * Transfer files in and out of containers
   * Management of multiple LXD hosts through the lxc command line tool
   * Experiment with the LXD [REST API](/lxd/rest-api/)

  Support for other container images, container migration, container configuration and profiles
  and a stable REST API will be coming in the next few releases.

  This release is our first development snapshot and isn't intended for production use
  and comes with no support statement from upstream. 
  (reported bugs and patches will be included in the next release)
