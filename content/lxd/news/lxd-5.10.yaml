  ### Introduction
  The LXD team is very excited to announce the release of LXD 5.10!

  As our first release of 2023, this is a bit of a lighter one as the team has been enjoying a two weeks break for the holidays. Next month's release is going to be where we see some of the larger new features of 2023 start landing.

  That's not to say that LXD 5.10 is boring. Besides a continued push to get the most performance out of our database and preparatory work for upcoming features, this still manages to introduce some quality of life improvements and a good number of bugfixes.

  Enjoy!

  ### New features and highlights
  #### Reworked instance documentation
  The instance documentation has now been re-structured to match the new style of our documentation. This means separate pages for instructions on performing common actions as well as separate pages for the various device types.

  This makes it all easier to navigate as well as significantly easier to link to.

  Documentation: https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/docs/latest/instances/

  #### Reworked server documentation
  The server documentation has also seen some initial re-organization happening to it.
  There's still more to come in that area as we work towards cleaning up the Manage LXD section of the documentation, but in this release you can already see a better structured main page with clean sub-sections and navigation.

  #### Network pie charts in the Grafana dashboard
  Our Grafana dashboard is a great way to identify your top instances.
  Up until now, we had charts covering the top 5 instances for CPU, memory and disk.

  By user request, we have now extended that to also cover network usage with 4 new charts covering top transmit traffic, top receive traffic as well as top transmit packets and top receive packages.

  As a reminder, our dashboard can be either downloaded directly from the LXD source repository at https://github.com/lxc/lxd/blob/master/grafana/LXD.json

  Or it can be retrieved from Grafana directly (ID 15726): https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/15726-lxd/

  #### Configurable network transmit queue length on NIC devices
  A new `queue.tx.length` setting is now available for veth-based `nic` devices.
  This means it's limited to containers using one of `bridged`, `p2p` or `routed` nic types.

  This new configuration key allows for setting the `txqueuelen` setting on the network interface. This can be useful when encountering latency issues that are related to packet queuing and can be used to either decrease the queue length forcing a lower latency behavior or on the contrary, increasing the queue length to try to increase throughput.
