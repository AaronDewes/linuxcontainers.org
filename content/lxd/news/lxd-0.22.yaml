  ### The main changes for this release are

   * Freeze containers before killing them (helps with fork bombs)
   * Configurable image compression algorithm (also supports no compression)
   * Support using an HTTP proxy when downloading a remote image
   * Initial implementation of the events interface and minimal client for it (lxc monitor)

  ### Bugfixes

   * Don't remove the main LXD socket when starting a second daemon
   * On failure to add a remote, cleanup the cached certificate
   * LXD no longer requires a client certificate to talk to public endpoints
   * Better error and debug messages for checkpoint/restore and container startup
   * Fixed a race condition during container startup
   * Update the busybox test image to avoid an occasional hang
   * lvm-setup: Update to work on older Ubuntu releases
   * Fix extraction of bz2 compressed images
   * Fix a number of fd leaks
   * Fix shmount handling to avoid creating an extra mount everytime LXD starts
   * lxd-images: Fallback to the daily stream if an image can't be found in the releases stream
   * Fix a uid/gid mapping issue on container copy
   * Fix a LXD hang on invalid LXC configuration key

  ### Upgrade notes
  This LXD version corrects a problem in the implementation of the images API,
  as a result, some actions against older servers or using older clients may fail.
