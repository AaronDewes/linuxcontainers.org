  ### The main changes for this release are

   * "lxc publish" can now be forced to publish running containers (it will temporarily stop them)
   * "lxc image list" now shows images sorted by description
   * Complete review of the REST API and update to make it all match the specification.
      * GET /1.0 now shows the "public" field
      * GET /1.0/certificates now returns a valid list of endpoints
      * GET /1.0/containers/NAME for performance reasons no longer returns the detailed container runtime status ("status" key), a separate query to /1.0/containers/NAME/state is now needed
      * GET /1.0/containers/NAME/logs now returns a valid list of endpoints
      * POST /1.0/containers/NAME/snapshots no longer requires the "stateful" field to be set (defaults to false)
      * POST /1.0/images now lets you override "properties" and "filename" for all supported input types
      * GET /1.0/images/aliases/NAME now returns valid data (the "name" and "target" fields were swapped)
      * POST /1.0/images/aliases/NAME has been implemented
      * PUT /1.0/images/aliases/NAME has been implemented
      * GET /1.0/images/FINGERPRINT no longer shows an empty "target" field for aliases
      * GET /1.0/networks/NAME has been re-designed
      * GET /1.0/operations/UUID/wait?timeout=X now actually times out
      * POST /1.0/profiles/NAME has been implemented
      * All timestamps are now RFC3339 strings and consistently named (created\_at, updated\_at, expires\_at, uploaded\_at)
      * Synchronous replies no longer contain an empty "operation" field
   * Extra security now applies for cross-server communication:
      * Unless a certificate is passed along with the query, the following operations now require the remote certificate to be valid according to system CA:
           * Container creation from migration (copy, move & live migration)
           * Container creation from remote image
           * Image copy from other LXD server
           * Image import from https
      * The command client will automatically set the necessary "certificate" field for you for those requests
   * Starting with this release, Go 1.3 is no longer supported by LXD.
