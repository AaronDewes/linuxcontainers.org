  ### The main changes for this release are

   * New --mode argument to "lxc exec", makes it possible to force non-interactive mode.
   * Full support of the s390x architecture (IBM z/series 64bit)
   * Command aliases can now move the command arguments by using the @ARGS@ keyword
   * Full support for CPU limits (defaults to all CPUs, maximum priority and no time limit):
      * limits.cpu: Number of CPUs (e.g. 2) or range of core (e.g. 0,2-3)
      * limits.cpu.allowance: Percentage of CPU time under load (e.g. 50%) or hard time limit (10ms/50ms)
      * limits.cpu.priority: Container priority when host is under load as a value between 1 (lowest) and 10 (highest) (e.g. 5)
   * Full support for memory limits (defaults to all memory, hard enforcement, swap enabled and maximum priority):
      * limits.memory: Limit in bytes (kB, MB, GB, TB, PB, EB suffixes supported) (e.g. 256MB) or in percentage of the host memory (e.g. 20%)
      * limits.memory.enforce: hard (container cannot use more memory than allocated) or soft (limit only applies under load)
      * limits.memory.swap: true or false, indicates whether the container may use the swap
      * limits.memory.swap.priority: Priority for swap usage, from 1 to 10, with 1 causing the most data to be swapped out to disk
   * All CPU and memory limits are now applied live.
   * Support for optimized (send/receive) ZFS container & snapshot migration

  ### Bugfixes

   * Fix a variety of storage race conditions as identified by new tests
   * lxd-images: Give clearer error messages
   * Fix image expiry logic
   * Refactor logging code
   * Fix migration code to be spec-compliant
   * Detect available CGroup controllers
   * zfs: Prevent restoring from old (not latest) snapshosts
   * Report clearer errors when adding devices to containers
   * zfs: Fix container rename
   * lvm: Fix container rename
   * lvm: Workaround failure on older LVM versions
   * lvm: Hide fdleak messages
   * Move some directories around for consistency
   * exec: lock fds map for exclusive writes
   * lvm: Fix snapshot rename handling
   * lvm: Fix container snapshot migration
   * Fix container DB cleanup (leftover records)
   * Fix image cleanup (leftover records)
   * Use the host architecture when container arch == 0
   * Do config & device validation upstream
   * Cleanup DB leftovers
   * Return a clear error message when an image already exists
   * Only return remote\_cache\_expiry if set
   * Flush volatile when they don't apply

  ### Testsuite

   * The testsuite can now be run with all storage backends
   * Several race conditions have been eliminated
   * The testsuite now checks that the filesystem structure is clean
   * The testsuite now checks that the database tables are clean
   * Fix a couple of tests whose failure was being ignored
   * Dramatically speed up testsuite by using --force-local
   * Use shutdown and waitready commands

  ### Upgrade notes

   * limits.memory suffixes are now kB, MB, GB, TB, EB and PB. Old
     suffixes are upgraded as a one-time operation on the next LXD startup.
   * The migrate REST API call now takes a https URL to the source
     operation rather than a wss URL to the secrets. This was changed to
     match the specification.
