content: |-
  LXD 2.1 is the first feature release following LXD 2.0 LTS.

  Note that this release does not have LTS status and as such will not  
  benefit from multi-year support or bugfix releases.

  For production environments, we recommend that you stick to the LXD 2.0 LTS release.

  ### The changes in this release include
  New features:

   * client: Add a `lxc shell` alias by default
   * client: Build unix-like aliases directly into LXC (`lxc {cp,ls,mv,rm}`, `lxc image {cp,ls,rm}`, `lxc image alias {ls,rm}`, `lxc remote {ls,mv,rm}` and `lxc config device {ls,rm}`)
   * client: Generate the client certificate on-demand
   * client/copy: Allow additional profiles and config to be set
   * client/copy: Pick a random name if not specified and same host
   * client/image: Add --format and json output
   * client/image: Allow deleting multiple images at once
   * client/list: Add support for config key columns (e.g. `lxc list -c ns,security.privileged:privileged`)
   * client/profile: `lxc profile apply` is now `lxc profile assign`
   * client/profile: New `lxc profile add` and `lxc profile remove` sub-commands
   * client/version: Do not show the version command by default
   * daemon: Add a global core.https\_allowed\_credentials key
   * daemon: Implement ETag support for all PUT calls
   * daemon: Implement PKI authentication (see doc/lxd-ssl-authentication.md)
   * daemon: Implement the PATCH method for all endpoints already supporting PUT
   * daemon/container: : Add config key for container force shutdown timeout (boot.host\_shutdown\_timeout)
   * daemon/container: Add some seccomp knobs (security.syscalls.{blacklist,blacklist\_default,blacklist\_compat,whitelist} and raw.seccomp)
   * daemon/container: Add support for the "usb" device type (see doc/configuration.md)
   * daemon/container: Record the last used date for containers (also expose in `lxc info` and `lxc list`)
   * daemon/zfs: Allow forcing snapshot removal through configuration (storage.zfs\_remove\_snapshots)

  Bugfixes:

   * All the bugfixes listed as part of LXD 2.0.1, 2.0.2, 2.0.3 and 2.0.4
   * tests: Fix for newer shellcheck
   * lxd-bridge: Fail on dnsmasq failure
