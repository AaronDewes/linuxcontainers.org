  ### Introduction
  The LXD team is pleased to announce the release of LXD 2.0.12!

  This is the twelfth bugfix release for LXD 2.0 which is supported until June 2021.

  ### Bugfixes and improvements
  As our oldest LTS, LXD 2.0 has not seen a release since 2.0.11 in October 2017.

  This LTS branch is very much in security-only mode and this release only includes some older bugfixes that missed 2.0.11 and then fixes to keep this branch of LXD buildable.

  As part of this, some of our dependencies no longer build on old Go versions, LXD 2.0.11 was confirmed to build and run with Go 1.13, 1.14 and 1.15 and was confirmed not to be buildable on 1.11 at least.

  With no critical fix or security issues in there, distributions requiring an older Go version should stay on 2.0.11.

  And lastly, we urge any user who's still using LXD 2.0 LTS to upgrade to something more modern as this branch only gets critical security updates and will reach its end of life in less than a year. Upgrades from 2.0 LTS directly to 4.0 LTS are supported.
