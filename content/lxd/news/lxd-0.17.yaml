   * A bunch more fixes, tests and other improvements

  Note that as of this release, the use of "lxd-images import lxc" is
  deprecated in favor of using the images.linuxcontainers.org remote.

  For example:

      lxd-images import lxc centos 7 amd64 --alias centos
      lxc launch centos my-container

  Now becomes:

      lxc remote add images images.linuxcontainers.org    # one-time setup
      lxc launch images:centos/7/amd64 my-container
