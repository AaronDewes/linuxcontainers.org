  ### The main changes for this release are

   * GET /1.0/containers/NAME/snapshots/SNAPNAME now returns the configuration and devices included in the snapshot
   * Three new configuration options have been introduced to configure the daemon to use an HTTP proxy
      * core.proxy\_https (if not set, uses HTTPS\_PROXY env variable)
      * core.proxy\_http (if not set, uses HTTP\_PROXY env variable)
      * core.proxy\_ignore\_hosts (if not set, uses NO\_PROXY env variable)
   * Cache remote simplestream data for an hour in the daemon so we don't hammer the remote server
   * Allow for auto-update of images coming from a LXD server

  ### Bugfixes

   * Change ConnectInfo to take a RemoteConfig.
   * Workaround kernel overmounting protection

   * zfs: fix handling of the "snapshot only" send case
   * Allow reducing the LVM LV size and update tests
   * profiles: don't mask error message when not found
