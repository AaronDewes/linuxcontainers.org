  ### Introduction
  The LXD team is very excited to announce the release of LXD 4.0 LTS!

  This is the 3rd LTS release for LXD and a very busy and exciting one!
  The changelog below is split so that both users of LXD 3.23 and LXD 3.0 can see what we have in store for them.

  As with all our other LTS releases, this one will be supported for 5 years (June 2025) and will receive a number of bugfix and security point releases over that time.

  As for LXD 3.0, we're hoping to release one last bugfix release as 3.0.5 in the near future before we enter security-only maintenance mode for its remaining 3 years.

  Enjoy!

  ### Breaking changes
  #### Removal of `--container-only`, replaced by `--instance-only`
  Our only CLI breaking changes with this release is the replacement of `--container-only` by `--instance-only`. Those following the feature releases will have had both supported for a few months now. With the 4.0 release, we're removing the deprecated ones.

  ### Highlights for 3.23 users
  #### virtual machines: Support for backup (import/export)
  It is now possible to use `lxc export` and `lxc import` with virtual machines.

  A word of caution however. Virtual machines, unlike containers are only accessible as a large block device. This means that several GB of data will need to be read and compressed, no matter how much is actually used inside the VM.

  This can lead to long export times and similarly long import times.

  Doing so with `--optimized` on a backend like ZFS should considerably reduce the export time, assuming the backup is to be imported on a storage pool of the same type.

  #### resources: PCI and USB devices in the resource API
  The resources API (`/1.0/resources`) has been extended with a list of all PCI and USB devices on the system. This is of particular use when dealing with VFIO passthrough to virtual machines or passing through USB devices to containers.

  #### network: Support for multiple ipvlan NIC devices
  Multiple ipvlan devices can now be added to the same container provided that one of them has `ipv4.gateway` and/or `ipv6.gateway` set to `none`.

  #### network: Support for host addresses on routed NIC
  The host side address on `routed` nics can now be configured through the `ipv4.host_address` and `ipv6.host_address` properties.

  #### clustering: Support for editing cluster roles
  A new `lxc cluster edit` command allows for editing clustering roles.

  It's worth noting that there currently are no writable roles, but we expect to be adding some in the near future which will then be manageable through this API and command.

  #### instances: Disk usage for custom volumes
  Containers with custom storage volumes attached to them will now report those volume's usage in the state API (and through `lxc info`):

      stgraber@castiana:~$ lxc launch images:ubuntu/bionic c1
      Creating c1
      Starting c1
      
      stgraber@castiana:~$ lxc storage volume create default vol1

      Storage volume vol2 created
      
      stgraber@castiana:~$ lxc storage volume attach default vol1 c1 vol1 /mnt/vol1
      stgraber@castiana:~$ lxc storage volume attach default vol2 c1 vol2 /mnt/vol2

  #### instances: Disk usage for snapshots

  The API now exposes the size of each individual snapshots.

      stgraber@castiana:~$ lxc snapshot c1
      stgraber@castiana:~$ lxc query /1.0/instances/c1/snapshots/snap0 | jq .size
      61440

  This will soon be displayed in `lxc info` once it's gone through a redesign.

  #### auth: Support for passwordless PKI mode
  For those using LXD with a managed PKI, it is now possible to configure LXD to automatically trust any client certificate signed by the CA.

  This is done with `core.trust_ca_certificates`.

  To handle revocation, LXD also now accepts a CRL which should be placed alongside `server.ca` as `server.crl`.

  ### Highlights for 3.0 users
  In addition to the features and changes listed above, those who were using the LXD 3.0 LTS branch have the following "new" features to look forward to:

  #### Virtual machines
  LXD can now run both containers and virtual machines.

  The experience and configuration works in much the same way though some device types and configuration options aren't available for virtual machines yet.

  Some operations are performed through an agent running in the virtual machine (`lxc exec` and `lxc file`). The agent comes pre-installed in the majority of our images.

  To create a virtual machine rather than a container, simply pass `--vm` to `lxc launch`

  VM images are now available for most commonly used Linux distributions with plans to add more in the future.

  #### Projects
  Projects are a way to segment your LXD server.
  Each project can contain its own set of instances, images, profiles and storage volumes.

  Those various features can be enabled/disabled on a per-project basis. If disable, the project inherit from the `default` project.

  On top of this, there is support for both restrictions (disabling particular device types, privileged containers, ...) and limits (limiting the amount of CPU, memory and instance count).
