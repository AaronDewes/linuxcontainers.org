  ### Introduction
  The LXD team is very excited to announce the release of LXD 3.12!

  This is one of the more feature packed releases and if you are a cluster user, there should be a lot to be happy about!

  We have taken a look through all LXD commands and how they work against clusters, improved our APIs where they were lacking and tweaked the commands to give cluster operators a better experience.

  But cluster improvements are far from the only thing improved with this LXD releases.

  We've also finally got `shiftfs` support! This feature we've been planning for well over a year is finally there when combined with a suitable kernel. With this, LXD containers don't need any slow shifting on initial startup, reducing the filesystem delta and making container creation so much faster!

  Lastly, resource reporting was significantly improved, both in the API and the CLI. We now have more details about the CPU topology, especially NUMA for multi-socket systems and are also now exposing GPU configuration.

  Enjoy!

  ### New features
  #### Cluster: Aggregated DHCP leases

  LXD managed networks that span multiple cluster members now show a unified view of their DHCP leases, showing hostname, MAC, address and the cluster member's name for each lease.

      root@edfu:~# lxc network list-leases lxdfan0
      +----------+-------------------+--------------+---------+----------+
      | HOSTNAME |    MAC ADDRESS    |  IP ADDRESS  |  TYPE   | LOCATION |
      +----------+-------------------+--------------+---------+----------+
      | a1       | 00:16:3e:2b:de:8c | 240.31.0.206 | DYNAMIC | edfu     |
      +----------+-------------------+--------------+---------+----------+
      | a2       | 00:16:3e:01:99:58 | 240.34.0.124 | DYNAMIC | djanet   |
      +----------+-------------------+--------------+---------+----------+
      | a3       | 00:16:3e:b4:8b:94 | 240.36.0.96  | DYNAMIC | nuturo   |

      +----------+-------------------+--------------+---------+----------+

  #### Cluster: Events now show location
  Event messages are now all marked with the name of the originating cluster member as their location. 

      location: edfu
      metadata:
        class: task
        created_at: "2019-04-05T04:13:21.212580932Z"
        description: Creating container
        err: ""
        id: 0c8e4a7d-ef7b-41a0-b949-7030f9aa6827
        location: edfu
        may_cancel: false
        metadata: null
        resources:
          containers:
          - /1.0/containers/a10
        status: Running
        status_code: 103
        updated_at: "2019-04-05T04:13:21.212580932Z"
      timestamp: "2019-04-05T04:13:21.223834434Z"
      type: operation


  Additionally LXD will now only forward log messages of importance WARN or higher to other members, keeping the INFO and DBUG messages local to reduce network chatter. This behavior can be changed by starting the LXD daemon in debug mode, at which point all log levels will be broadcasted again.

  #### Cluster: Operations now show location
  Another area that now benefits from clear tracking of cluster members is operations, as can be seen in `lxc operation list`:

      root@edfu:~# lxc operation list
      +--------------------------------------+-----------+-------------------+---------+------------+----------------------+----------+
      |                  ID                  |   TYPE    |    DESCRIPTION    | STATUS  | CANCELABLE |       CREATED        | LOCATION |
      +--------------------------------------+-----------+-------------------+---------+------------+----------------------+----------+
      | 36c11142-52d8-4c1e-a342-63657096cdec | WEBSOCKET | Executing command | RUNNING | NO         | 2019/04/05 04:19 UTC | edfu     |
      +--------------------------------------+-----------+-------------------+---------+------------+----------------------+----------+
      | 701175cf-df82-4ef5-8078-a25d83b770b3 | WEBSOCKET | Executing command | RUNNING | NO         | 2019/04/05 04:19 UTC | djanet   |
      +--------------------------------------+-----------+-------------------+---------+------------+----------------------+----------+

  This now makes it clear what cluster member is busy doing what and should simplify making sure that a system isn't actively used before performing maintenance on it.

  #### Cluster: Support for `--target` in more commands
  The following commands have now grown support for `--target`:

   - lxc config edit/get/show/set/unset
   - lxc info [--resources]
   - lxc network info
   - lxc storage info

  This makes it possible to configure some member-specific daemon configuration options, query cluster member runtime information and system resources, get detailed network statistics and storage usage.

  #### Shiftfs support
  This is a feature we've been looking forward to for years and that we are really excited to finally see coming to completion. `shiftfs` allows for an unprivileged container experience that doesn't need any shifting of the filesystem, instead having the kernel do it on the fly.

  This requires kernel support through the `shiftfs` filesystem which is currently a custom patchset that will be present in the Ubuntu 19.04 kernel.

  LXD automatically detects support for this and will transparently start using it whenever possible.  

  #### Kernel features now exported over API
  For some time now, LXD has been detecting a number of optional kernel features on startup and would print an overview then. That same information is now exposed over the API and visible in `lxc info`.

        kernel_features:
          netnsid_getifaddrs: "true"
          shiftfs: "true"
          uevent_injection: "true"
          unpriv_fscaps: "true"

  #### Improved CPU reporting
  The server resources API now exposes CPU sockets and NUMA node information, making it easier to do CPU pinning for containers.

      root@djanet:~# lxc info --resources --target edfu
      CPUs:
        Socket 0:
          Vendor: GenuineIntel
          Name: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU           E5430  @ 2.66GHz
          Cores: 4
          Threads: 4
          Frequency: 1999Mhz (max: 2336Mhz)
          NUMA node: 0
        Socket 1:

        Driver: ast (4.15.0-47-generic)
        NUMA node: 0

  The output of `lxc info --resources` has also been tweaked to adapt to the hardware present on the system.

  #### GPU reporting
  As you may have noticed in the previous listing, GPUs are now present in the system resources output. Additional information can also be seen for NVIDIA cards:

      root@vm10:~# lxc info --resources
      CPU:
        Vendor: GenuineIntel
        Name: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2695 v2 @ 2.40GHz

  #### Snapshot expiry now visible in `lxc info`
  On top of showing when a snapshot was taken, snapshots that have an expiry will now show their expiry in the listing too.

      root@djanet:~# lxc info a1
      Name: a1
      Location: edfu
      Remote: unix://
      Architecture: x86_64
      Created: 2019/04/05 04:07 UTC
      Status: Stopped
      Type: persistent
      Profiles: default
      Snapshots:
        snap0 (taken at 2019/04/05 04:20 UTC) (expires at 2019/04/05 05:20 UTC) (stateless)
