   * Fix invalid permissions on container shmounts and devices directories
   * Fix container teardown not always cleaning up devices & mounts
   * Improve performance of host-triggered container stop/restart (5s faster)
   * Make lxd callhook timeout after 30s (instead of hanging indefinitely on failure)
