title: LXD 0.19 release announcement
date: 2015/09/29 00:00
content: |-
  The main changes for this release are:

   * ZFS support
   * Support for container nesting
   * Allow setting multi-line configuration keys by reading from stdin (using "-" as the value)
   * It's now possible to make an ephemeral copy of a container (-e/--ephemeral flag)
   * Public read-only servers are now auto-detected (no more --public needed)
   * lxd-images now supports updating existing images (when using the --sync flag)
   * It is now possible to mark/unmark images as public (through the edit command)

  Additionally:

   * A completely reworked testsuite
   * Some refactoring in preparation for a Windows client
   * Updated documentation and specifications
   * A lot of bugfixes (no known bugs left at time of release)

  Note that due to an API implementation problem in past releases, older command line clients  
  will fail to interact with LXD 0.19's image store. Such clients should be upgraded to 0.19.
