title: LXD 2.0.0.rc1 release announcement

  This is the first release candidate for LXD 2.0. This means that we believe all features required
  for LXD 2.0 have now been merged and we only expect bugfixes and minor usability improvements
  to land between now and final release.

  ### The main changes for this release are

   * Support for the Cgroup namespace.
   * It is now possible to set the lxc.network.X.ipv{4,6}[.gateway] raw.lxc keys (with usual caution with regard to raw.lxc)
   * /proc and /sys are now clean straight mounts when the container is unprivileged
   * The scope of IP addresses is now exported and used to filter local addresses out by default
   * lxc exec now defaults to non-interactive mode when stdout isn't a tty
   * All the tables rendered by the client now look alike
   * Simplestreams is now natively supported by both the client and the server, eliminating the need for lxd-images
   * Background image syncronization is now supported by the server and done by-default for all cached images
   * The last time an image was used and whether it's stored in the cached is now exported over the API and visible in "lxc image info"
   * Profiles now have a description field
   * It is now possible to do a stateful container stop where the container is checkpointed to disk rather than killed, then resumed on next start.
   * A "docker" profile is now present by default with those settings required to be able to run Docker inside a LXD container.
   * Image import now reports upload progress.

  ### Bugfixes

   * Refactor the GenCert function so it can be reused.
   * tests: get rid of commented out code
   * Rework lxd.NewClient so we don't need a disk cache.
   * shared: export limit parsing function
   * Add upgrade procedure to README
   * websocket: fix panic() on concurrent writes
   * Don't allow the state functions to fail
   * specs: Remove section on Etag (not implemented)
   * specs: Fix rest-api layout
   * list: Fix crash on PID column
   * Fix name printing on lxc init
   * Fix a variety of issues with blkio limits
   * Fix hardcoded architecture path in apparmor profile
   * tests: Fix failure on networked test
   * tests: Fix the number of certs check
   * Fix snapshot configuration
   * Don't rely on the filesystem to check if stateful
   * Catch checkpoint failures
   * Fix DB test
   * Better lock around event listeners
   * Fix container not rebooting properly
   * Add package "make" to build dependencies installation command
   * Don't stop at an unsatisfactory sub?id entry
   * client: better error on `lxc stop remote:`
   * Just use the shared struct whenever possible in the client
   * Fix download progress on launch
   * Fix alignment of numbers in tables

  ### Upgrade notes

   * This release deprecates the lxd-images tool, instead use the ubuntu:
     and ubuntu-daily: default remotes to achieve the same feature. If you
     absolutely must copy an image into the local store, it can be done with
     "lxc image copy ubuntu:14.04 local: --alias ubuntu".
