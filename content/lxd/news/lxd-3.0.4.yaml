  ### Introduction
  The LXD team is pleased to announce the release of LXD 3.0.4!

  As a stable bugfix release, no major changes have been done, instead focusing on bugfixes and minor usability improvements.

  ### Highlights
  #### Migration feature negotiation
  Rsync and ZFS options are now being negotiated as part of migration, avoiding container migration issues when moving between different LXD versions or different host OS versions.

  #### Additional progress reporting
  Some commands like `lxc launch` and `lxc publish` will now report additional progress information in some situations.
