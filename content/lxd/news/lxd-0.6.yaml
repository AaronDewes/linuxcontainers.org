  The major changes for this release are:

   * Added a vagrant configuration file
   * The container's MAC address is now persistent
   * Variety of fixes regarding remote servers handling
   * Recursive query support (massive speed improvement for image servers)
   * TLS now configured to only support strong ciphers
   * Support setting aliases at image import time
   * Improved test coverage
   * Improved error messages on the client
   * Fix privileged containers handling
   * LXD can now be built on powerpc

  Please note that it's still early in the LXD development and that current LXD isn't intended  
  for production use and comes with no support statement from upstream.  
  (reported bugs and patches will be included in the next release)
