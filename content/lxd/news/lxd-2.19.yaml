  ### The changes in this release include
    Features:

     * The LXD documentation is now available at https://lxd.readthedocs.io
     * A new "resources" API was added allowing to get CPU and memory information as well as storage pool sizes from the API. In the client, this maps to "lxc info --resources" and "lxc storage show NAME --resources".
     * A new set of limits.kernel.[limit name] container configuration keys are available to tweak the various kernel process limits for the container.
     * The command line client now has a number of "rename" subcommands, for profiles, networks and image aliases. The toplevel "rename" command was also updated to match.
     * The LXD API now allows renaming of custom storage volumes. In the client tool, this can be done through "lxc storage volume rename".
     * Extended the LXD user-agent to include the kernel version, architecture and OS name and release. This will allow LXD image servers to show a filtered image list when applicable.
     * Added a new insecureSkipVerify flag to ConnectionArgs struct in the client allowing to connect to a LXD host bypassing any kind of TLS validation.
