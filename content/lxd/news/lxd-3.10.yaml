  ### Introduction
  The LXD team is very excited to announce the release of LXD 3.10!

  This release introduces snapshot expiry which combined with automated snapshots in LXD 3.8 should make for a nice way to have LXD generate and cleanup snapshots in the background.

  We also did some work on our import/export of containers, now allowing overriding the storage pool during import.

  This release also fixes a wide variety of bugs and has a number of nice performance improvements around compression/decompression and improved progress reporting thanks to the ChromeOS team at Google.

  Enjoy!

  ### New features
  #### Snapshot expiry
  A new `snapshots.expiry` container configuration option now lets you define an expiry for newly created containers. Alternatively, a snapshot can now be directly edited to set the newly introduced Expiry field.

  When a snapshot expires, it is automatically deleted. This feature is particularly useful when combined with automated snapshots.

  #### Pool override on import
  It is now possible to select what storage pool a container backup should be imported into. On the command line, this can be specified with `--storage`.
