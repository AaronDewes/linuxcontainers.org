title: LXD 2.4.1 release announcement
date: 2016/10/05 01:00
content: |-
  The primary goal for this release is to publish release tarballs that actually report LXD
  as "2.4.1" rather than "2.3" as the release ones mistakenly did.

  We're including a couple of bugfixes in the process too.

  ### The changes in this release include
  Bugfixes:

   * shared: Remove logging import
   * tests: add a test to make sure we don't accidentally include new deps
   * extras: Added the command shell to lxc-client bash-completion

  ### Downloads
  The release tarballs can be found on our [download page](/lxd/downloads/).
