  ### Introduction
  The LXD team is very excited to announce the release of LXD 3.11!

  As most of our current work is large features and refactoring, this release mostly contains bugfixes based on reported issues and bugs we found along the way.

  It also features the same C hardening work which has been ongoing on the LXC side for a while now, which should reduce the chances of any mistakes being made in that sensitive code.

  That's not to say there isn't anything new in this release, a number of small improvements to our user experience have been included, improving progress reporting, snapshot handling and centralized authentication.

  Enjoy!

  ### New features
  #### Configurable snapshot expiry at creation time
  Past releases introduced automated snapshots and then automated snapshot expiry.

  As a configured default expiry applies to all snaphosts, not just automated ones and it's a bit of a hassle to manually create snapshots just to then go and edit them to change their expiry, it's now possible to set an expiry at snapshot creation time.

  At the API level this can be done with an exact timestamp which if set to `null` will make a persistent snapshot regardless of any configured auto-expiry.

  At the CLI level, this can be used with the new `--no-expiry` flag to `lxc snapshot`.

  #### Progress reporting for publish operations
  When running `lxc publish` against a container or snapshot, some progress information is now displayed. This is similar to image transfers and container migrations and should help confirm that something is indeed happening.

  #### Improvements to Candid authentication
  A few changes happened to how Candid authentication is handled by the CLI:

  ##### Per-remote authentication cookies
  Prior to this release, a shared "cookie jar" was used for all remotes.

  This would sometimes cause inconsistent behaviors when two remotes were using the same Candid authentication server as adding the second remote would re-use the existing cookie, potentially ignoring the authentication domain and not requiring a new authentication roundtrip.

  Now every remote has its own "cookie jar" and LXD's behavior when adding remotes is now always identical.

  ##### Candid preferred over TLS for new remotes
  When using `lxc remote add` to add a new remote, if that remote supports Candid for authentication, this will be used instead of TLS authentication.

  The authentication type can always be overridden with `--auth-type`.

  ##### Remote list now shows Candid domain
  The remote list will now indicate what Candid domain is used, when one was specified during `lxc remote add`:

      stgraber@castiana:~$ lxc remote list
