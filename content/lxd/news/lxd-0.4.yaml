title: LXD 0.4 release announcement
date: 2015/03/17 00:00
content: |-
  The major changes for this release are:

   * Support for starting a container from a remote image
   * Support for copying/moving containers between hosts
   * Improved command line (listing, aliases, profiles, partial hashes, ...)
   * Improved error logging
   * API fixes to more closely match the spec
   * A lot of bugfixes

  Please note that it's still early in the LXD development and that current LXD isn't intended
  for production use and comes with no support statement from upstream.
  (reported bugs and patches will be included in the next release)

  At this point, most core LXD features are present but many of the
  particular options aren't implemented yet (don't match our
  specifications), we expect to make great progress in supporting all of
  the expected options over the next couple of releases.
