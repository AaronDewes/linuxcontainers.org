   * Improve file push/pull reliability
   * Make it possible to start/stop/restart/delete multiple containers at once
   * Fix build under gccgo (currently disabling /dev/lxd in such case)
   * Improve btrfs performance during container copy
   * A lot of other bugfixes, minor improvements and cleanups
