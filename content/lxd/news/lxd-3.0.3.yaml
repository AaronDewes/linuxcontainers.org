  ### Introduction
  The LXD team is pleased to announce the release of LXD 3.0.3!

  As a stable bugfix release, no major changes have been done, instead focusing on bugfixes and minor usability improvements.

  ### Highlights
  #### Cluster refreshes for snap environments
  A common issue with LXD clusters is the requirement that all nodes run the same LXD version and have a matching set of API extensions and DB schema.

  When any node goes ahead of the rest, all database operations are held back until the remainder of the nodes are upgraded.

  As we're talking about a number of separate machines, coordinating that upgrade may be a bit tricky and in the case of the LXD snap, could take up to 24h without user intervention.

  To improve this, we introduced a new `LXD_CLUSTER_UPDATE` environment variable which packagers can set, pointing it to a script which will update the local LXD daemon through the relevant package manager. When LXD detects that another node is now ahead of itself, it will call this script which will then update the local LXD and have it match.

  #### Rsync option negotiation
  This release includes support for the rsync option negotiation which got rolled out in LXD 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7. This should result in smoother migrations between varying LXD releases.

  #### Improved Candid support
  Candid external authentication was extended to support multiple domains as well as providing with configurable expiry for the authentication tokens (defaulting to 1h).

  This allows administrators in large organizations to choose what Candid domains will be allowed on a particular LXD server and configure exactly how long a user will be trusted before having to renew their authentication token with Candid.

  The relevant configuration keys are:
   - candid.domains (comma separate listed of domains, default to allow all)
   - candid.expiry (token expiry in seconds, default to 3600)

  #### Added support for PEM encrypted keys
  For added security, LXD now supports PEM encrypted keys, this means that you can now manually encrypt your `~/.config/lxc/client.crt` using openssl and LXD will then prompt you for the password as needed.

      stgraber@castiana:~$ lxc project list s-vorash:
      Password for client.crt: 
      +-------------------+--------+----------+---------+
      |       NAME        | IMAGES | PROFILES | USED BY |
      +-------------------+--------+----------+---------+
      | default (current) | YES    | YES      | 28      |
      +-------------------+--------+----------+---------+

  #### Added support for LXD_INSECURE_TLS
  While all our own image servers and internal communications support modern ciphers, it's been brought to our attention that some corporate environments will intercept TLS traffic through their proxy and using a company CA, terminate the TLS connection on the proxy to inspect the traffic.

  This would work fine so long as the company CA is trusted on the system and LXD is configured to use the company proxy. Unfortunately, it appears that many such proxies also do not support the modern ciphers that LXD requires, effectively causing all outgoing TLS connections to fail.

  For those environments, we have now added a new `LXD_INSECURE_TLS` environment variable which is respected by both `lxd` and `lxc` and that will instruct LXD to relax the ciphers requirements, using the default TLS settings from Go rather than using our restricted set of trusted ciphers.

  #### Expanded exec operation metadata
  Ever wondered what that `exec` session is about in `lxc operation list`?

  Well, now LXD lets you find that out by looking at some extra metadata that's recorded as part of the `exec` operation.

      stgraber@castiana:~$ lxc exec xenial -- sleep 30 &
      [1] 25911
      
      stgraber@castiana:~$ lxc operation list
