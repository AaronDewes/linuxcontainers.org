  The main changes for this release are:

   * Added storage and network hotplug
   * Improved logging
   * Improved LVM and btrfs backend
   * /dev/lxd now works with gccgo
   * Added new environment.\* configuration namespace to set environment variables inside the container
   * Init and launch now print the container name
   * lxd-images now defaults to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
   * --tcp has now been replaced by the core.https\_address config option
   * Improved LVM and btrfs support
   * Add some LXD speed tests
   * New "make client" target to only build the LXD client (use this for MacOS X)
   * Introduce new scripts and http proxy code for a lxdbr0 bridge
   * Rework internal storage representation
   * Rework internal container representation
   * Rework internal database representation
   * Various testsuite improvements
   * A lot more bugfixes and other small improvements

  This release moves containers from /var/lib/lxd/lxc to /var/lib/lxd/containers  
  and snapshots from /var/lib/lxd/lxc/\<name\>/snapshots to /var/lib/lxd/snapshots/\<name\>.
  To do so, LXD will stop all containers on the next startup, then start them again  
  after moving everything to the new location.

  The --tcp daemon option has been replaced by the core.https\_address option allowing users  
  to change the address and port LXD binds to. Changes are now applied immediately.
