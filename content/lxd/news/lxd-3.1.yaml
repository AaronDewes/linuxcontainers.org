  ### Introduction
  LXD 3.1 is the first feature release following our last LTS release (3.0).
  As a feature release, it will only be supported until LXD 3.2 is released next month.

  We recommend critical production environments stick to the LTS branch instead.
  If you're using the snap, you can enforce that with `snap refresh lxd --channel=3.0`.

  Note that LXD **does not** support downgrades, so a system that's upgraded to LXD 3.1 will not be able to go back to LXD 3.0.0.

  ### Note for Ubuntu users
  LXD 3.1 will only be made available as a snap package. We will not be uploading it as a deb to Ubuntu 18.10 or through backports to previous releases. Moving forward all feature releases of LXD will only be available through the snap.

  Note that this does NOT affect users of LXD 3.0.x as present in Ubuntu 18.04 where further bugfix/security releases will be uploaded as debs until Ubuntu 18.04 reaches end of life.

  ### The changes in this release include
  Features:
   - Introduced a new backup API and ability to export/import containers using it.
     In the CLI those are new `lxc export` and `lxc import` commands:

   - Made it possible to override the LXD socket path with `LXD_SOCKET`
   - Made it possible to disable the use of privileges containers through a new `LXD_UNPRIVILEGED_ONLY` environment variable.
