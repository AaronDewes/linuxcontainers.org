  ### The main changes for this release are

   * A new "lxd init" command is available to help setup storage, network and password on new LXD installations
   * Log messages are now sent over the events API
   * New process count metric available in the containers API and in "lxc info"
   * Console color support on Windows
   * Rewritten operations handling, now includes events for each changes and includes download status
   * "lxc image import" can now take the URL to an https webserver advertising a LXD image through HTTP headers
   * The minimal HTTP proxy shipped by LXD has been rewritten to be even lighter

  ### Bugfixes

   * "lxc config get \<server-config-key\>" now works as expected
   * lxd-images: Much lower memory usage when importing an image
   * More readable log entries over the events API
   * Event filtering in "lxc monitor" now works properly
   * Container architectures are now properly tracked
   * LXD now ensures that published containers will always have metadata in their image
   * Container copy now copies devices and config properly
   * Image import failure now result in proper error messages
   * "lxc info --show-log" is now also suggested on "lxc launch" failures

  ### Upgrade notes
  Users of the operations API may have to update their code to suit the new operation code.  
  The new implementation is now specification-compliant, meaning that all operation queries  
  always return a full operation object wrapped in an Async reply and with operation-specific  
  properties inside the metadata.

  The "lxc" client was updated to be backward compatible when possible.
