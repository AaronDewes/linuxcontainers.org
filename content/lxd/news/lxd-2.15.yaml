  ### The changes in this release include
  New features:

   * "lxc image list" now support column customization.
   * "lxc list" and "lxc image list" now both support table, json, yaml and csv as output formats.
   * It's now possible to cancel (DELETE) some background operations while they're downloading content.
   * The "lxc" command line tool was ported from our old client code to the new client package.
     This was the last bit of code which needed porting and we're now
     planning on removing the old client package from our tree with LXD 2.16.
   * New CopyContainer and CopyContainerSnapshot functions were added to the client package.
   * LXD will now dynamically remap custom storage volumes when attached to containers.
