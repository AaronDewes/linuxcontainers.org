  ### The changes in this release include
  New features:

   * Ceph RBD can now be used as a LXD storage backend (including "lxd init" support).
   * A new security.idmap.base key has been added.
      This controls what base uid/gid to use on the host when using security.idmap.isolated.
   * Image downloads can now be interrupted.
   * File transfers now support sending symlinks
   * "lxc copy" and "lxc move" will now show progress information
   * "lxc copy" and "lxc move" now support "relay" and "push" modes to go around firewalls and NAT
   * Custom storage volumes can now have their size set and modified
   * "lxc image import" now supports reading from a directory containing an unpacked image
   * The "vlan" property can now be set on "physical" network interfaces (was just "macvlan")
   * It's now possible to delete image volumes from a storage pool.
     This allows removing a storage pool without having to remove the images from the image store.
   * The image metadata and template files can now be created and modified over the API.
     This allows fine tuning of all image metadata prior to publishing.
   * Stateful snapshots can now be restored as a new container on a remote host.
