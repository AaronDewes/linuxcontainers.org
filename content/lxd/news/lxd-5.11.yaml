  ### Introduction
  The LXD team is very excited to announce the release of LXD 5.11!

  This is a pretty packed release with a couple of big highlight features, specifically the instance placement scriplet and ZFS zvol support but also included are quite a few other smaller features, performance improvements and bugfixes.

  Enjoy!

  ### New features and highlights
  #### Instance placement scriptlet
  A common request from cluster users has been to provide a better alternative to LXD's default placement algorithm.

  By default LXD will quite simply look at all suitable cluster members and select whichever is currently hosting the fewest instances. It doesn't care about whether they're containers or VMs, whether they're currently running or not, how much resources the same may have and how much of it may be in use at the time.

  As there are about as many opinions on placement as there are clusters out there, we decided to go with something that's both very flexible, yet very fast and reliable.
  Instead of a potentially pretty complex internal scheduler which may not fit everyone's needs or an external scheduler which can go down, we went with something that's new for LXD.

  Enter scriptlets. Scriptlets as the name may suggest are little scripts.
  In LXD's case, we're using Starlark scripts specifically which is a very limited dialect of Python. Those scripts are directly loaded into the application, in this case LXD and can be provided with some data and functions to call.

  Pretty importantly, those scriptlets cannot access any local data, hit the network or even perform complex time consuming actions (no loops and the like).

  In LXD's case, we're introducing a new config key, `instances.placement.scriptlet` which can be set to a Starlark scriptlet. Then whenever LXD needs to place an instance, it will call that scriptlet, provide it with a list of candidate cluster members, the instance creation request itself and expose some functions that can be used to retrieve additional information about cluster members.

  Specification: https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/lxd-scriptlet-based-instance-placement-scheduler/15728
  Documentation: https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/docs/latest/explanation/clustering/#instance-placement-scriptlet

  #### Block storage mode on ZFS pools
  Something that was requested [over 5 years ago now](https://github.com/lxc/lxd/issues/3873) but recently caught our attention thanks to Docker and Android is the interest for using ZFS as a storage backend but not store data within ZFS datasets but rather use ZFS volumes.

  This leads to an experience that's very similar to LVM or Ceph but on the very capable ZFS backend. It can also be used to mix and match, having some specific custom volumes use zvol while the rest of the data uses datasets.

  This is interesting for both Android containers and for Docker storage as in both cases, ZFS isn't compatible with the way they expect to store data. With this feature it's now possible to flip the storage mode to zvol for Android containers, getting them running on the expected ext4 filesystem, and for Docker, one can now carve out a custom storage volume that's formatted as ext4 for use as /var/lib/docker, allowing for the use of the much faster overlay2 vfs driver.

  Documentation: https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/docs/latest/reference/storage_zfs/#storage-volume-configuration

  #### `lxc cluster info` command
  As part of the placement scriptlet work described above, one thing we needed was for an easy way to retrieve load information about a cluster member.

  Rather than only having this available as an internal function, we decided to also make it available over the API and provide a CLI command for it.

      stgraber@dakara:~$ lxc cluster info s-shf-cluster:athos
      sysinfo:
        uptime: 30219
        load_averages:
        - 12.13
        - 9.77
        - 9.62
        total_ram: 676309450752
        free_ram: 319631790080
        shared_ram: 123550392320
        buffered_ram: 32219648000
        total_swap: 8589926400
        free_swap: 8589926400
        processes: 4330
      storage_pools:
        hdd:
          space:
            used: 23882062033615
            total: 30893314601679
        ssd:
          space:
            used: 2452640672159
            total: 10217284610463

  It provides pretty raw data about the system load, memory and disk usage and number of processes.


  #### Support for attaching managed physical networks to instances
  `physical` managed LXD networks were first introduced to serve as uplink for OVN networks. But seeing how LXD also supports attaching to physical network interfaces, there was no good reason not to allow their use through the `network` property.

  Documentation: https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/docs/latest/reference/devices_nic/#nic-physical

  #### Reworked image documentation
  Continuing with our documentation rework, in this release we now have the images documentation re-organized to match the rest of our docs.
