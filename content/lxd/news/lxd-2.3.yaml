title: LXD 2.3 release announcement

  LXD 2.3 includes a few major features we've been working on for months.

  The main one is a completely new set of API endpoints, configuration options and commands.
  This allows creating and configuring bridges through LXD, including IPv4
  and IPv6 connectivity, Ubuntu FAN support, cross-host tunnels with GRE
  or VXLAN, various DNS modes, DHCP configuration and MAC filtering.

  The other feature we're very excited about is support for AppArmor
  namespaces and stacking. This will allow containers to load apparmor
  profiles and further confine their workloads.

  ### The changes in this release include
  New features:

   * Introduce the new network management API
      * POST to /1.0/networks (see rest-api.md)
      * PUT to /1.0/networks/NAME (see rest-api.md)
      * PATCH to /1.0/networks/NAME (see rest-api.md)
      * DELETE to /1.0/networks/NAME (see rest-api.md)
      * "lxc network" commands
      * Network configuration in "lxd init"
      * The default profile now comes without network configuration
      * The old lxd-bridge code has been removed
      * Details of configuration options in configuration.md
   * Support for AppArmor namespaces and profile stacking
      * On supported kernels, containers will now be able to use apparmor
   * Introduce a new storage.lvm\_mount\_options daemon configuration option
   * Rework log message priorities and add more context to log messages
   * "lxc info" now shows the remote name in its output
   * The client now includes the remote name in error messages
