  ### Introduction
  This month's LXD release comes with a lot of bugfixes and performance improvements, especially for those using LXD clustering.

  Feature wise, this release has a lot of improvements for those using the `proxy` device type first introduced in LXD 3.0, foundation work for image download improvements in nested environments and closes a big gap in our storage story by allowing containers to be copied and moved between pools.

  ### The changes in this release include
  Features:

   * Added a [new API to /dev/lxd](http://lxd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev-lxd/#10images) allowing for direct download of public
     and cached images from the host (requires security.devlxd.images)
   * Added support for copying and moving containers between storage pools
   * Big improvements to the [proxy device](https://lxd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/containers/#type-proxy):
      * Unix socket support (including OOB packets)
      * UDP support
      * Port ranges for UDP and TCP
   * New [simplified cluster join API](https://lxd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rest-api/#10cluster)
