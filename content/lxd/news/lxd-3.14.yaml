  ### Introduction
  The LXD team is very excited to announce the release of LXD 3.14!

  This release's focus is on stability and performance with a strong focus on networking and clustering.

  Users of advanced networking features will see a lot of improvements in interface tracking, restoration of past state and error handling. On the clustering side, some database improvements should reduce overall load when containers start/stop and DNS handling with Ubuntu Fan bridges was completely reworked for a much better experience.

  Enjoy!

  ### New features
  #### Cluster: Re-worked DNS forwarding
  The DNS forwarding logic used for clusters using Ubuntu Fan bridges has been updated to better handle nodes joining/leaving the cluster as well as now handling PTR (reverse DNS) records.

  #### Script to factory reset LXD
  A [new script](https://github.com/lxc/lxd/blob/master/scripts/empty-lxd.sh) is now included for those users who would like to completely empty a LXD server of all containers, images, profiles, networks and projects. This can be particularly useful as part of cleanly removing LXD from the system.

  #### Improvements to syscall interception
  The syscall interception feature got some nice improvements, adding support for the `mknodat` syscall alongside the existing `mknod` syscall, offloading of some of the argument comparison to the kernel so only device nodes request get intercepted and overlayfs' whiteout file has been added to the list of allowed syscalls, resolving a number of issues with running Docker inside of LXD.

  This feature requires a 5.0 kernel or higher, a current git snapshot of libseccomp and a current git snapshot of liblxc, so it will not be widely available in distributions shipping LXD but the `edge` snap package, combined with a suitable kernel will have all the needed bits in place.
