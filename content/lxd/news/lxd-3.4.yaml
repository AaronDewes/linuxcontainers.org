  ### Introduction
  The LXD team is very excited to announce the release of LXD 3.4!

  The main highlight for this release is the major performance improvement that made it in.
  We upgraded to a newer version of our database backend, introduced new internal APIs for batch queries, made it possible to query all container states in one API call and fixed a number of bottlenecks that were quite negatively affecting cluster performance.

  Initial tests show that a cluster running several thousand containers will now usually return basic container status (`lxc list --fast`) in just a couple of seconds with most other operations also significantly faster than in the past. Things aren't quite as fast as we'd like them to be yet, especially when querying the full container state of hundreds/thousands of containers (`lxc list`) but we're working on a few options to improve that too.

  As for new features, we added progress reporting to a few missing commands in our command line client, added support for aliasing to external commands and added support for cross-host DNS when using a Fan bridge on a LXD cluster.

  Enjoy!

  ### Important notes
  #### Fixed container snapshot and backup naming
  In the past, the `name` property of all snapshots and backups included the container name followed by a slash and then by the snapshot or backup name.

  This was redundant given that you could only get this information by querying a particular container.

  The API now only returns the snapshot or backup name but LXD still understands the old syntax to allow for migrations and restoring of existing backups.

  #### Switched to a newer implementation of dqlite
  `dqlite`, the distributed sqlite3 implementation that we started using for LXD in LXD 3.0 has been significantly reworked to remove a number of performance bottlenecks.

  Most of the database logic is now done inside a C library ([`libdqlite`](https://github.com/CanonicalLtd/dqlite)) with a matching Go package ([`go-dqlite`](https://github.com/CanonicalLtd/go-dqlite)) providing the SQL interface for LXD.

  The on-disk format remains unchanged, so there's no risky upgrade step for this but packagers need to be aware of the new library and package it with LXD.

  #### Renamed `lxc remote set-default` to `lxc remote switch`
  We renamed `lxc remote set-default` to the much friendlier and shorter `lxc remote switch`, this is in preparation for work on LXD projects which will have a similar `switch` subcommand.

  `lxc remote set-default` remains valid as an alias of `lxc remote switch`.

  #### Renamed the `macaroon` authentication options to `candid`
  Now that a standard implementation of macaroon based authentication is publicly available in the [Candid project](https://github.com/CanonicalLtd/candid) we have updated LXD to support it and renamed our configuration options to match.

  This primarily affects the old `core.macaroon.endpoint` which has now been renamed to `candid.api.url`. Upgrading to LXD 3.4 will automatically convert one into the other.


  ### New features
  #### Fan-aware DNS resolving for clusters
  One problem several users ran into when running a LXD cluster using the Ubuntu Fan as an overlay network was that even though all traffic was properly routed between the various nodes, attempting to resolve the name of a container would only work if it happened to be running on the same cluster node.

  LXD 3.4 changes that by now attempting to resolve DNS queries for the network's defined domain (`lxd` by default) against all of the nodes until one returns a value, making it feel like it's all handled by a single unified DNS server.

  #### Faster API for container status
  A new `/1.0/containers?recursion=2` API has been added which allows for retrieving all containers, their configuration, their state, their snapshot list and their backup list in a single call.

  This effectively lets you move from making 1 main API call followed by 3 additional calls per container to just doing a single call.

  #### Progress information in `lxc file` and `lxc import`
  Transferring files or uploading a backup to LXD will now get you progress information.
  When available, you'll get the percentage transferred and current speed, when the size is unknown, you'll still get how much was transferred and the transfer speed.

  #### Aliases to external commands
  It's now possible to setup aliases in the command line client which point to external commands. All you have to do is have the alias begin with the absolute path to the command to execute.

      lxc alias add my-script "/usr/local/bin/myscript @ARGS@ --extra-args"


  #### File capabilities support
  All calls to `tar` and `rsync` now pass the required options to save and restore extended attributes, including file capabilities.

  On top of that, we've implemented logic in our `idmap` package to shift and unshift files that include file capabilities, using the recently introduced unprivileged file capabilities.

  On suitable kernels (upstream 4.14+) this will now allow LXD images to include file capabilities for utilities such as `ping` or `mtr` and have users of privileged or unprivileged containers alike be able to set and use those capabilities.
