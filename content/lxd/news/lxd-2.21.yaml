title: LXD 2.21 release announcement
date: 2017/12/20 00:00
content: |-
  ### The changes in this release include
  Features:

   * The `lxc start/stop/restart/pause` commands now accept a new `--all` flag.
   * Introduced a new `infiniband` device type which supports physical
     passthrough of Infiniband devices as well as SR-IOV allocated cards.
   * Added a new `security.devlxd` configuration key to control the
     presence of /dev/lxd inside the container.
   * Added support for incremental memory copy with container live-migration.
     This is controlled by a set of new `migration.incremental.memory`
     configuration keys.
   * A new `boot.stop.priority` configuration key can be used to control
     container shutdown order when LXD is brought down.
   * LXD users that use MAAS to manage their networks can now have LXD
     directly drive MAAS, recording all containers in MAAS and setting up
     static allocations in MAAS managed subnets.
     This is controlled with the `maas.api.url` and `maas.api.key`
     daemon keys as well as the `maas.subnet.ipv4` and `maas.subnet.ipv6`
     network interface configuration keys.
