  ### The changes in this release include
  New features:

   * New client library
      * Add a CreateContainerFromImage function
      * Implement image upload
      * Implement remote operations
   * API additions
      * New "description" field for containers, networks, storage pools and storage volumes
      * Allow for image refreshes (lxc image refresh)
   * When launching containers, an existing cached image is now preferred over downloading a refreshed one
   * "lxd init" can now be preseeded with "--preseed" and a yaml config file
   * Introduce a new btrfs.mount\_options pool property
