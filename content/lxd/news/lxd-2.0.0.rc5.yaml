  ### Bugfixes

   * Improve error reporting on image POST
   * Fix error handling logic around snapshots
   * Fix container shutdown to actually happen in parallel
   * Document 'auto\_update' parameter for 'POST /1.0/images'
   * stateful start: rework behavior
   * stateful snapshots: rework behavior
   * Bind-mount mqueue if unprivileged
