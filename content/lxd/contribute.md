# Source code

The current development version of LXD can be cloned from GitHub with:

Contributions sent upstream for review must be based on the current git tree and not on stable releases, unless the bug only affects a stable release.

# Patch submission process

Contributions to LXD must be submitted as GitHub pull-requests and we require them to be signed-off.

More details on contribution guidelines may be found [here](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/docs/master/contributing)

# Stable release backports

In general, all bugfixes will be picked up for the stable release, this however tends to happen in batches every couple of months or so. If we missed a given patch, please file a bug so we can look into it.

Note that only bugfixes are backported to stable releases.
