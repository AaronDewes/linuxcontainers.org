## LXD 2.4.1 release announcement <span class="text-muted">5th of October 2016</span>
The primary goal for this release is to publish release tarballs that actually report LXD  
as "2.4.1" rather than "2.3" as the release ones mistakenly did.

We're including a couple of bugfixes in the process too.

### The changes in this release include

Bugfixes:

 * shared: Remove logging import
 * tests: add a test to make sure we don't accidentally include new deps
 * extras: Added the command shell to lxc-client bash-completion

### Downloads
The release tarballs can be found on our [download page](/lxd/downloads/).

## LXD 2.3 release announcement <span class="text-muted">27th of September 2016</span>
LXD 2.3 includes a few major features we've been working on for months.

The main one is a completely new set of API endpoints, configuration options and commands.  
This allows creating and configuring bridges through LXD, including IPv4  
and IPv6 connectivity, Ubuntu FAN support, cross-host tunnels with GRE  
or VXLAN, various DNS modes, DHCP configuration and MAC filtering.

The other feature we're very excited about is support for AppArmor  
namespaces and stacking. This will allow containers to load apparmor  
profiles and further confine their workloads.

### The changes in this release include
New features:

 * Introduce the new network management API
    * POST to /1.0/networks (see rest-api.md)
    * PUT to /1.0/networks/NAME (see rest-api.md)
    * PATCH to /1.0/networks/NAME (see rest-api.md)
    * DELETE to /1.0/networks/NAME (see rest-api.md)
    * "lxc network" commands
    * Network configuration in "lxd init"
    * The default profile now comes without network configuration
    * The old lxd-bridge code has been removed
    * Details of configuration options in configuration.md
 * Support for AppArmor namespaces and profile stacking
    * On supported kernels, containers will now be able to use apparmor
 * Introduce a new storage.lvm\_mount\_options daemon configuration option
 * Rework log message priorities and add more context to log messages
 * "lxc info" now shows the remote name in its output
 * The client now includes the remote name in error messages

Bugfixes:

 * apparmor: Be less restrictive when unprivileged
 * apparmor: create an apparmor namespace for each container
 * doc: Fix rest-api for PATCH addition
 * doc: Fix the table sytle of environment.md
 * extras: Containers state checking for start, stop and exec commands in bash completion

## LXD 2.0.2 release announcement <span class="text-muted">30th of May 2016</span>
This is the second bugfix release for LXD 2.0 and its first security update.

## CVE-2016-1581
Robie Basak noticed that after setting up a loop based ZFS pool through "lxd init"  
the resulting file (/var/lib/lxd/zfs.img) was world readable.

This would allow any user on the system, and a potential attacker to copy and  
then read the data of any LXD container, regardless of file permissions inside the container.


LXD 2.0.2 fixes the "lxd init" logic to always set the mode of zfs.img to 0600.

Additionally a one-time upgrade step will trigger on first run and reset any existing  
zfs.img mode to be 0600.


If you manage an affected system and suspect an unauthorized user may have accessed  
the zfs.img file, you should consider replacing any secret that was stored in the  
affected containers (private keys and similar credentials).

## CVE-2016-1582
Robie Basak noticed that when switching an unprivileged container (default, security.privileged=false)  
into privileged mode (by setting security.privileged to true), the container rootfs is properly  
remapped but the container directory itself (/var/lib/lxd/containers/XYZ) remains at 0755.

This is a problem because it allows an unprivileged user on the host to access any world readable path  
under /var/lib/lxd/containers/XYZ which may include setuid binaries.

Such setuid binaries could then be used on the host to access otherwise unaccessible data  
or to escalate one's privileges.


LXD 2.0.2 fixes this behavior by making sure all privileged containers are always root-owned and have  
their mode set to 0700 to prevent traversal by unprivileged users.

Additionally a one-time upgrade step will trigger on first run and reset any existing privileged containers'  
ownership and mode to root:root 0700

## LXD 2.0.0.rc1 release announcement <span class="text-muted">2nd of March 2016</span>

This is the first release candidate for LXD 2.0. This means that we believe all features required  
for LXD 2.0 have now been merged and we only expect bugfixes and minor usability improvements  
to land between now and final release.

### The main changes for this release are

 * Support for the Cgroup namespace.
 * It is now possible to set the lxc.network.X.ipv{4,6}[.gateway] raw.lxc keys (with usual caution with regard to raw.lxc)
 * /proc and /sys are now clean straight mounts when the container is unprivileged
 * The scope of IP addresses is now exported and used to filter local addresses out by default
 * lxc exec now defaults to non-interactive mode when stdout isn't a tty
 * All the tables rendered by the client now look alike
 * Simplestreams is now natively supported by both the client and the server, eliminating the need for lxd-images
 * Background image syncronization is now supported by the server and done by-default for all cached images
 * The last time an image was used and whether it's stored in the cached is now exported over the API and visible in "lxc image info"
 * Profiles now have a description field
 * It is now possible to do a stateful container stop where the container is checkpointed to disk rather than killed, then resumed on next start.
 * A "docker" profile is now present by default with those settings required to be able to run Docker inside a LXD container.
 * Image import now reports upload progress.

### Bugfixes

 * Refactor the GenCert function so it can be reused.
 * tests: get rid of commented out code
 * Rework lxd.NewClient so we don't need a disk cache.
 * shared: export limit parsing function
 * Add upgrade procedure to README
 * websocket: fix panic() on concurrent writes
 * Don't allow the state functions to fail
 * specs: Remove section on Etag (not implemented)
 * specs: Fix rest-api layout
 * list: Fix crash on PID column
 * Fix name printing on lxc init
 * Fix a variety of issues with blkio limits
 * Fix hardcoded architecture path in apparmor profile
 * tests: Fix failure on networked test

### Upgrade notes

 * This release deprecates the lxd-images tool, instead use the ubuntu:
   and ubuntu-daily: default remotes to achieve the same feature. If you
   absolutely must copy an image into the local store, it can be done with
   "lxc image copy ubuntu:14.04 local: --alias ubuntu".

## LXD 0.23 release announcement <span class="text-muted">24th of November 2015</span>

### The main changes for this release are

 * A new "lxd init" command is available to help setup storage, network and password on new LXD installations
 * Log messages are now sent over the events API
 * New process count metric available in the containers API and in "lxc info"
 * Console color support on Windows
 * Rewritten operations handling, now includes events for each changes and includes download status
 * "lxc image import" can now take the URL to an https webserver advertising a LXD image through HTTP headers
 * The minimal HTTP proxy shipped by LXD has been rewritten to be even lighter

### Bugfixes

 * "lxc config get \<server-config-key\>" now works as expected
 * lxd-images: Much lower memory usage when importing an image
 * More readable log entries over the events API
 * Event filtering in "lxc monitor" now works properly
 * Container architectures are now properly tracked
 * LXD now ensures that published containers will always have metadata in their image
 * Container copy now copies devices and config properly
 * Image import failure now result in proper error messages
 * "lxc info --show-log" is now also suggested on "lxc launch" failures

### Upgrade notes

Users of the operations API may have to update their code to suit the new operation code.  
The new implementation is now specification-compliant, meaning that all operation queries  
always return a full operation object wrapped in an Async reply and with operation-specific  
properties inside the metadata.

The "lxc" client was updated to be backward compatible when possible.

### Upgrade notes

This LXD version corrects a problem in the implementation of the images API,  
as a result, some actions against older servers or using older clients may fail.

To do so, LXD will stop all containers on the next startup, then start them again  
after moving everything to the new location.

The --tcp daemon option has been replaced by the core.https\_address option allowing users  
to change the address and port LXD binds to. Changes are now applied immediately.
